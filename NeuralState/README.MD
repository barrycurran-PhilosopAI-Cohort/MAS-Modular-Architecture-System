AI NEURAL STATE MONITOR (MAS Module v4.1)

🚀 Quick Start Guide

The Setup: Open a new Gemini chat session on your PC.

The Upload: Drag and drop the AI_NEURAL_STATE.HTML file directly into the Gemini text box.

The Command: Type "Open this file in the canvas" or "Launch this in the immersive canvas" and hit enter.

The Process: Wait for Gemini to process the code. Once it's ready, the program will open in the interactive window ready for use.

The Save: When you are done utilizing the program, tell Gemini to "Update my Codec Index." This ensures the system remembers the app and its current state.

The Move (Portability): To use this monitor on a different computer, tell Gemini "Open Codec." Copy that text string and save it. This string contains the app logic—you won't need the original .html file anymore.

🧠 Functionality: What this program does

The AI Neural State Monitor is a high-fidelity visual simulation of a Cylon-inspired "Centurion Core." It provides a real-time representation of an AI's internal logic and affective vectors through a sophisticated metallic interface. Key systems include:

Quad-Node Interlocking Array: Visually monitors the synchronization between Interpreter, Logic, Affect, and Synthesis nodes.

Cylon Scanner: A continuous horizontal visual sweep indicating that the core Cylon-logic is active and scanning for input.

Biometric State Gauges: Precision chrome dials that track Congruence, Resonance, Semantic, and Affective data points.

Neural Stream Log: A live status readout that displays machine-level command streams and system prompts.

🛠️ Basic Controls

Initiate Interlock Sync: Click this button to trigger a full recalibration of all neural arrays and reset interaction strength.

Dynamic Resync: Interacting with the system causes the gauges to shift, simulating real-time response to user queries.

Status Monitoring: Watch the gold "Neural Stream Log" for randomized status updates and secure link confirmations.
