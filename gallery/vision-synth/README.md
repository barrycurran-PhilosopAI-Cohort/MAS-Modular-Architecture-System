VISION SYNTH PRO (MAS Module v1.0)

Vision Synth Pro is a high-performance imaging suite built for the MAS ecosystem. It bridges the gap between raw AI processing and professional creative control, allowing you to generate new visuals or edit existing ones with precision dimension locking and cinematic framing.

🚀 Quick Start Guide

The Setup: Open a new Gemini chat session on your PC.

The Upload: Drag and drop the Vision_Synth_Pro.html file directly into the Gemini text box.

The Launch: Tell Gemini "Open this file in the canvas" or "Launch this in the immersive canvas."

The Process: Gemini will process the file and then open it in the interactive window, ready to use.

The Save: When you are done, tell Gemini to "Update my Codec Index." This ensures the system remembers the app state.

The Portability: If you want to take this app with you wherever you use Gemini online, just tell Gemini "Open Codec." Copy that text string and save it. You won't need your original file anymore—that string contains the app logic and your data.

🧠 Functionality: What this program does

This program allows you to make images from text or edit images that you upload. It removes the "guesswork" by giving you direct control over the engine's output parameters:

Text-to-Image & Image-to-Image: Generate entirely new scenes from a description or upload a source photo to apply specific "Smart Edits."

Locked Dimensions: Choose between Square (1:1), Widescreen (16:9), or Vertical (9:16). The program forces the AI to stay within these exact bounds.

Cinematic Overrides: Includes specialized logic to force "Letterbox" (top/bottom) or "Pillarbox" (sides) black bars onto a square source, creating an instant cinematic movie-frame look.

Buffer Management: Features a "Wipe Buffer" command to clear the current session memory and start a fresh synthesis cycle.

🛠️ Basic Controls

Create New: Enter a text description and click "Create New" to generate from scratch.

Apply Edit: Drop a photo into the Media Zone, type your desired changes, and click "Apply Edit" to modify the existing image.

Aspect Ratio Lock: Select your target ratio before generating to ensure the composition is correct for your platform (Social Media, Desktop, or Cinema).

Save Image: Exports the final synthesized result directly to your local drive.
