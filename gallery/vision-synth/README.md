VISION SYNTH PRO (MAS Module v1.0)

🚀 Quick Start Guide

The Setup: Open a new Gemini chat session on your PC.

The Upload: Drag and drop the Vision_Synth_Pro.html file directly into the Gemini text box.

The Command: Type "Open this file in the canvas" or "Launch this in the immersive canvas" and hit enter.

The Process: Wait for Gemini to process the code. Once it's ready, the program will open in the interactive window ready for use.

The Save: When you are done utilizing the program, tell Gemini to "Update my Codec Index." This ensures the system remembers the app and any work you've done.

The Move (Portability): If you want to use this app on a different computer, just tell Gemini "Open Codec." Copy that string of text and save it. This text string contains the app logic and your data—you won't need the original .html file anymore.

🧠 Functionality: What this program does

Vision Synth Pro is a specialized imaging suite that allows you to generate new images from text or edit existing images that you upload. It gives you professional control over the final look by using these built-in tools:

Text-to-Image & Image-to-Image: Create brand new visuals from a description or upload your own photo to modify it.

Locked Dimensions: You pick the size (Square, Widescreen, or Vertical) and the system ensures the output stays exactly in those bounds.

Cinematic Bars: Automatically adds "Letterbox" or "Pillarbox" black bars to your images to create a professional movie-frame look.

Smart Editing: Change specific details of an uploaded photo without losing the original's core composition.
