Space Quest I (1986) - Modern Reconstruction

A Tribute by Barry Curran, the Architect

🚀 Overview

This project is a faithful "Cloud Cartridge" reconstruction of the 1986 Sierra On-Line classic "Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter", created by the Two Guys from Andromeda (Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy).

This version brings the adventures of Roger Wilco—the galaxy's most famous janitor—into a modern single-file HTML5 interface. It features the classic countdown-to-destruction logic, a responsive text parser, and visual synthesis that reimagines the Arcada starship.

Original Authors: Mark Crowe & Scott Murphy (Sierra On-Line)
Release Year: 1986

This reconstruction is a special tribute to the humor and sci-fi wonder of the 80s. I spent countless nights trying to escape the Arcada before it self-destructed, and recreating this "Vertical Slice" is a way to preserve that specific thrill. It’s a perfect addition to the Cloud Cartridge Boutique for all the "geeks" out there who remember Roger Wilco fondly.

🛠️ How It Was Reconstructed

The game logic was "woven" by mapping the original AGI (Adventure Game Interpreter) scripts and room transitions.

The Parser: A robust JS implementation designed for sci-fi interactions (e.g., "SEARCH BODY", "ENTER POD").

The Timer: A real-time countdown engine that mirrors the Arcada's self-destruct sequence.

Visuals: Real-time visual synthesis generates 1980s-inspired EGA space art for each location.

UI Design: A "Galactic Command" interface with a neon-blue status bar and an integrated emergency alert timer.

🚀 How to Use
