VOCALIST PRO ELITE (v2.5.0) - Multinational Edition

Created and Encoded by Barry Curran, the Architect

🎙️ Overview

Vocalist Pro Elite is the definitive evolution of the long-form synthesis engine. While the original focused on simple "Chunk-and-Stitch," the Multinational Edition transforms the environment into a professional Global Production Suite. It allows users to translate, edit, regenerate, and master specific segments of a script in over 10 languages without losing progress on the rest of the project.

⚡ Quick Start Procedure

To initiate the engine within your AI session:

Launch Environment: Start a new session of Gemini (using Canvas). Ensure you are using a version that supports interactive previews.

Deploy Code: Copy the entire code block for tts_elite Multinational Edition V2.5.0 and paste it into the message box.

Initiate Interface: The interface will trigger the side-by-side preview window automatically.

Load & Localize: Drop your .txt file or paste your script. Use the Auto-Translate toggle to convert your script into your target language before processing.

🎖️ Elite Features & Upgrades

Universal Translation & Native Voice Array (New)

Integrated Localization: Gemini-driven translation logic that preserves tone and intent across 10+ global languages.

Native Dialect Support: Voices (Iapetus, Zephyr, Umbriel, Algenib, etc.) are specifically mapped to localized phonetic nuances for authentic delivery.

Granular Segment Editing

The core of the Elite engine. You no longer have to restart a massive project because of one mispronounced word.

Isolate & Edit: Click "Edit" on any specific chunk to pull it back into the Workspace.

Targeted Updates: Regenerate only that specific segment and update the master list instantly.

Visual State Tracking: Segment cards change color to indicate their status (Active, Completed, or Pending).

The "Nuclear Reset" System (Hard Purge)

Designed for high-reliability workflows where state-pollution is not an option.

Instant Mandatory Clear: Bypasses all standard dialogs for an instant purge.

DOM Overwrite: Manually forces every value, innerHTML, and audio source to a null state, ensuring a surgically clean slate.

Global Script Reconstruction

The "Reconstruct" tool allows you to pull the text from all active segments back into the main editor window. Essential for saving the final, polished version of a translated or edited script.

Advanced Mastering & Stitching

PCM-to-WAV Mastering: High-fidelity conversion of raw audio data into a single, seamless .wav master file.

Stitch Master Mix: Aggregates all processed segments into one continuous playback stream with one click.

Exponential Backoff: Military-grade error handling (up to 5 retries) for the synthesis API.

🛠️ Technical Workflow

Drop & Chunk: Paste your script. The engine intelligently slices it to preserve sentence integrity.

Translate: Toggle Auto-Translate to localize the text into the selected target language.

Batch or Single Sync: Synthesize the entire script at once or handle segments one-by-one for quality control.

Refine: Use Edit mode to tweak and regenerate only specific lines that need adjustment.

Master: Hit Stitch Master Mix to produce the final high-definition audio track for download.

🚀 Environment & Usage

Platform: Designed specifically for the Immersive Canvas environment.

Privacy: All processing is handled in-memory. The Nuclear Reset button wipes all local data instantly.
