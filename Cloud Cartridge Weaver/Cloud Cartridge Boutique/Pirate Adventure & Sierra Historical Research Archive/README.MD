Pirate Adventure & Sierra Historical Research Archive

Curated for: Barry Curran, the Architect

1. Primary Research URLs

For deep dives into the original source code and history:

Scott Adams Technical Breakdown: A Hopeful WordPress - Pirate Adventure BYTE 1980

The IF Archive: ifarchive.org

Historical Source (GitHub): github.com/historicalsource

Contains the AGI (Adventure Game Interpreter) source scripts for Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards (1987).

2. Technical Blueprint for "Up-Coding"

Scott Adams Engine (2-Word Parser)

Limit: Verb-Noun.

Truncation: First 3-4 letters.

Sierra AGI Engine (Leisure Suit Larry)

The Parser: More advanced than Scott Adams; supports full sentences, though often ignores filler words (the, a, at).

Global Logic: Uses "Logics" (scripts) that run every cycle.

Age Verification: A classic feature requiring the player to answer trivia to prove they are an adult.

3. Future Roadmap for "Cloud Cartridge" Weaver

Suggested titles for conversion into the App Boutique:

Strange Odyssey: Scott Adams' space-themed successor to Pirate Adventure.

Adventureland: The very first Scott Adams adventure (1978).

Leisure Suit Larry Series: Reconstructing the Lost Wages map via the Historical Source scripts.

Space Quest: Investigating the Sarien/AGI scripts for Roger Wilco's adventures.

4. Preservation Ethics

Status: These reconstructions are for personal, non-commercial use as a historical homage.
