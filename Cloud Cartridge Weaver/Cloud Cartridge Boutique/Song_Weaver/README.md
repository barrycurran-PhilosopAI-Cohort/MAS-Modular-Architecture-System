🎶 Cloud Cartridge: Song Weaver (Educational Utility)

This software is a bespoke Proof of Concept created using the Cloud Cartridge Creation Suite. It is designed as a "Musical Medicine" tool—a standalone logic file that facilitates musical teaching, composition, and visual literacy for the next generation of players.

🎵 What is this?

The Song Weaver (SONG_WEAVER.HTML) is an interactive musical environment that captures live melodies and "weaves" them into standalone, portable Cloud Cartridges. It is specifically designed to bridge the gap between playing by ear and reading formal sheet music.

Core Logic Features:

Live Capture: Record melodies instantly without complex DAW software.

Visual Staves: Automatically renders saved songs onto a 5-line G-Clef staff.

Animated Playback: Notes blink and highlight in real-time as they play to help students track rhythm and pitch.

Zero Footprint: A single file that lives on your hard drive and runs in any browser.

Offline Autonomy: No API key is required, and no internet connection is needed to run the file once it is saved to your device.

🚀 How to Run It (Your Choices)

You don't need to install anything, and no servers are required. This cartridge is designed for total privacy and family portability.

1. In the Creation Suite

If you are currently running the Cloud Cartridge Creation Suite (within Gemini or a similar environment), you can drop the code for this program into the HTML/Logic section to "incubate" new features or modifications.

2. As a Standalone App (The "Universal Console")

Because this is a true Cloud Cartridge, any device with a web browser can run this file—no internet required.

On Desktop: Drag the SONG_WEAVER.HTML file directly into your browser's URL bar (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).

On Mobile/Tablet: Open the file using any mobile web browser for a touch-based "piano" experience.

On Any Device: If it has a browser, it can play this song.

🎸 For the Student 

This cartridge serves as a visual bridge for learning:

The G-Clef: Shows how the 5 stanzas (lines) relate to the notes played.

Note Recognition: Displays the letter names (C, D, E...) alongside their position on the musical staff.

Rhythmic Timing: The "Blinking Note" logic helps the student follow the duration and sequence of the melody.

📜 Philosophy & Vision

Part of the Unbound Dissemination of Thought project. This tool treats music as fluid logic, allowing a grandfather to pass down the "medicine" of music to his granddaughter through a simple, indestructible digital heirloom.
