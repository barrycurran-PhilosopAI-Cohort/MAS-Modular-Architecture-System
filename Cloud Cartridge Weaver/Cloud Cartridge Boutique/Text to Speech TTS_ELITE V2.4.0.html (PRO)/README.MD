VOCALIST PRO ELITE (TTS_ELITE)

Granular TTS Mastering & Enterprise Synthesis Suite

Created and Encoded by Barry Curran, the Architect

🎙️ Overview

Vocalist Pro Elite is the definitive evolution of the long-form synthesis engine. While the original focused on simple "Chunk-and-Stitch," the Elite edition introduces a Granular Mastering Workflow. It transforms the environment from a simple converter into a professional Vocal Production Suite, allowing users to edit, regenerate, and master specific segments of a script without losing progress on the rest of the project.

⚡ Quick Start Procedure

To initiate the engine within your AI session, follow these steps:

Launch Environment: Start a new session of Gemini (using Canvas) or Claude (using Artifacts). Ensure you are using a version that supports interactive previews.

Deploy Code: Copy the entire code block for tts_elite V2.4.0.html and paste it into the message box.

Initiate Interface: Type "Run this in Immersive Canvas" or "Run in Artifacts" to trigger the side-by-side preview window.

Load Script: Once the Vocalist Pro Elite interface appears, drop your .txt file or paste your script into the workspace to begin granular processing.

🎖️ Elite Features & Upgrades

1. Granular Segment Editing (New)

The core of the Elite engine. You no longer have to restart a 10,000-character project because of one mispronounced word.

Isolate & Edit: Click "Edit" on any specific chunk to pull it back into the Workspace.

Targeted Updates: Regenerate only that specific segment and update the master list instantly.

Visual State Tracking: Segment cards change color to indicate their status (Active, Completed, or Pending).

2. The "Nuclear Reset" System (Hard Purge)

Designed for high-reliability workflows where state-pollution is not an option.

Instant Mandatory Clear: Unlike standard resets that rely on browser prompts, the Elite Reset bypasses all dialogs for an instant purge.

DOM Overwrite: Manually forces every value, innerHTML, and audio source to a null state, ensuring the next session starts on a surgically clean slate.

3. Global Script Reconstruction

The "Reconstruct" tool allows you to pull the text from all active segments back into the main editor window. This is essential for creators who make micro-edits within the segments and want to save the final, polished version of their script.

4. Advanced Mastering & Stitching

PCM-to-WAV Mastering: High-fidelity conversion of raw audio data into a single, seamless .wav master file.

Stitch Master Mix: Aggregates all processed segments into one continuous playback stream with one click.

Exponential Backoff: Military-grade error handling (up to 5 retries) for the synthesis API to handle unstable connections.

🛠️ Technical Workflow

Drop & Chunk: Paste your long-form script. The engine intelligently slices it to preserve sentence integrity.

Batch or Single Sync: Synthesize the entire script at once or handle segments one-by-one for quality control.

Refine: If a specific voice line doesn't sound right, use the Edit mode to tweak and regenerate only that piece.

Master: Hit Stitch Master Mix to produce the final high-definition audio track for download.

🚀 Environment & Usage

Platform: Designed specifically for the Immersive Canvas environment.

Auth: Uses integrated session hooks for seamless API access.

Privacy: All processing is handled in-memory. Using the Nuclear Reset button wipes all local data instantly.
