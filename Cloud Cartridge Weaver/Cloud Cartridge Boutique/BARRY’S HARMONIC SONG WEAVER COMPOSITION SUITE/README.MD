🎹 BARRY'S COMPLETE MUSIC COMPOSITION SUITE

Powered by Gemini & Soundfont // Build 2026.2

🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

Method A: The Immersive Canvas (Collaborative)

The Setup: Open a new Gemini chat session on your PC or laptop.

The Upload: Drag and drop Barry's_Free_Complete_Song_Creation_Mobile_Suite_V20.HTML directly into the chat.

The Command: Type "Open this in the immersive canvas" and hit enter.

The Process: Gemini renders the interface. You can now generate lyrics, compose melodies, and export notation in a high-performance environment.

Method B: The Portable App (Instant Browser Launch)

The Launch: Drag your HTML file from its folder and drop it directly onto your web browser's URL bar.

The Result: The browser initializes the interface as a standalone production app. The melodic engine and rhythmic logic work immediately.

Note: To enable AI-generated lyrics in standalone mode, insert your Gemini API key into the const apiKey = "" section using a text editor.

🎨 THE VIBE: RETRO-FUTURISTIC MIDI LOGIC

Note to the Modern Ear: This engine utilizes a "Beefed-Up" General MIDI soundscape. Unlike modern "black-box" generators, this is a Logic-First Studio. It embraces a raw, Lo-Fi aesthetic designed to provide the "skeletal" DNA of a song for the architect, the songwriter, and the hacker.

🧠 FUNCTIONALITY: WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES

Barry's Music Composition Suite is a precision-engineered harmonic production tool designed for the Architect to bridge abstract thought and musical structure.

📝 Generative Lyrical Foundation: Creates professional-grade lyrics and song titles using Gemini 2.5 Flash for thematic depth.

🎼 Harmonic Scale Constraints: A deterministic engine that anchors creativity within defined scales (Major, Minor, Blues, Pentatonic).

🥁 Rhythmic Style Grounding: Implements specific backing logic—from Jazz Walking basslines to Disco Pulses.

📜 ASCII Notation Archive: Captures every note in a high-contrast staff-visualizer for raw text exports (Sheet Music).

🛠 BASIC CONTROLS

📡 INITIATE BROADCAST: Triggers the AI and Web Audio API to begin real-time composition.

📽 SAVE SHOW: Exports a self-contained HTML presentation of your performance.

📄 SHEET (.txt): Generates a true ASCII-art musical staff with letter notes.

🛑 ABORT BROADCAST: Instantly severs the audio context and stops the performance.

🧹 CLEAR & RESET: Flushes the "Old Brain Disk" and resets the engine for fresh initialization.
