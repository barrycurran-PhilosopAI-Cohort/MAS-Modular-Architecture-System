The Notable Phantom (1986) - Modern Reconstruction

A Tribute by Barry Curran, the Architect

👻 Overview

This project is a modern reconstruction of the lost 1980s text adventure "The Notable Phantom." Originally conceptualized as a "type-in" game for home computers, this version brings the eerie atmosphere of Blackwood Manor into the modern era using a single-file HTML5/JavaScript engine.

The game maintains the classic Verb-Noun parser while introducing dynamic visual synthesis and a retro-terminal aesthetic inspired by the golden age of interactive fiction.

🎖️ Credit & Homage

Original Concept: Barry Curran

Reconstruction Year: 2024 (based on 1986 aesthetics)

This project serves as a historical archive and a personal tribute to the era of text-based exploration. It was designed to capture the specific tension of early 8-bit mystery games—where every room holds a clue and every item is a potential key to the afterlife.

🛠️ How It Was Reconstructed

The game was built to emulate the logic of the Scott Adams Adventure style:

The Parser: A custom JavaScript engine built to handle the classic two-word input system (Verb-Noun).

The Logic: A state-based inventory and room navigation system that tracks the location of the "Notable Phantom" and the specific items required to appease it.

Visuals: Integrated generative imaging that creates 8-bit, "EGA-style" pixel art based on room descriptions, providing a visual anchor to the text.

Interface: A "CRT Terminal" UI featuring scanlines, phosphor glow, and a monochromatic palette to evoke the feeling of 1980s computing.

🕹️ Game Rules & Commands

You must navigate the manor and solve the mystery of the ghost.

Movement: Use directions like GO NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, or DOWN.

Interaction: Use standard commands like GET [ITEM], DROP [ITEM], LOOK, or INVENTORY.

The Objective: Explore the manor, find the hidden artifacts, and discover what the Phantom is seeking.

The Parser: The computer only understands two words at a time (e.g., READ DIARY, LIGHT CANDLE).
