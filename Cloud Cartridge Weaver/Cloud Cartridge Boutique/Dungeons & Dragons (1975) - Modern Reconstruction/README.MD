Dungeons & Dragons (1975) - Modern Reconstruction

A Tribute by Barry Curran, the Architect

⚔️ Overview

This project is a high-fidelity "Turn-Based" reconstruction of the earliest electronic adaptations of Dungeons & Dragons, originally inspired by the PLATO-based dungeon crawlers and the foundational TSR tabletop rules.

This version utilizes a custom JavaScript engine to simulate the "Move, Look, Fight" rhythm of early RPGs within a single-file HTML5 interface. It combines classic d20-style combat logic with modern visual synthesis.

🎖️ Credit & Homage

Original Inspiration: Gary Gygax & Dave Arneson (TSR)
Era: 1970s - early 1980s

This reconstruction is a tribute to the "Electronic D&D" era—the transition from graph paper to glowing green screens. This "Cloud Cart" version honors the simplicity and lethality of early dungeon crawls, where survival was a matter of strategy and a lucky roll of the digital dice.

🛠️ How It Was Reconstructed

The game engine was "woven" by extracting core turn-based RPG mechanics from Open Source System Reference Documents (SRD).

The Parser: Focused on tactical movement (GO NORTH) and combat actions (ATTACK).

The Combat Engine: A randomized damage/defense system modeled after the original OSR (Old School Renaissance) mechanics.

Visuals: An integrated synthesis engine creates atmospheric dungeon environments in real-time.

UI Design: A "Gilded Parchment" interface with double-bordered frames and a permanent stat-tracking panel.
