Elizabeth's Toggle Peggle - Modern Reconstruction

A Tribute by Barry Curran, the Architect

🔵 🔴 Overview

This project is a modern reconstruction of physics-based arcade logic, specifically designed to explore the "Toggle" mechanic—a high-stakes variant of classic gravity-drop games.

This version brings traditional peg-clearing mechanics into the modern era using a single-file HTML5/JavaScript engine. It maintains a rigorous physics simulation while introducing dynamic state-switching and automated session persistence via achievement synthesis.

Original Concept Inspiration: Peggle (PopCap Games) / Pachinko Mechanics
Release Year: 2025 (Reconstruction)

This reconstruction is dedicated to the evolution of physics in gaming. Much like the transition from simple arcade sprites to rigid-body dynamics, this project was born out of a desire to share the mechanics of cause-and-effect with a new generation. It recreates the tension of the "perfect drop" while adding a strategic layer of point-sacrifice for board state manipulation.

🛠️ How It Was Reconstructed

The game engine was built from the ground up to ensure 1:1 parity between user input and physical reaction.

The Physics: Powered by Matter.js, meticulously tuned to simulate mass, friction, and gravity within a confined canvas environment.

The Toggle Logic: Every peg on the board functions as a state-machine. The "Reverse" (Red) nodes are programmed to flip the "Positive" (Gold) nodes, requiring the player to map out a path that balances loss against future gain.

Visuals: Integrated a high-performance rendering loop that handles particle effects and UI overlays without the need for external assets.

Persistence: Developed a custom snapshot engine that allows the state of the final board to be synthesized into a "Certificate of Achievement" for the player to archive.
