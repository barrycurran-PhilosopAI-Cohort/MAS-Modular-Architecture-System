Pirate Adventure (1978) - Modern Reconstruction

A Tribute by Barry Curran, the Architect

🏴‍☠️ Overview

This project is a faithful reconstruction of the 1978 classic "Pirate Adventure" (also known as Pirate Cove), originally created by Scott Adams and Alexis Adams.

This version brings the foundational text-based adventure into the modern era using a single-file HTML5/JavaScript engine. It maintains the original Verb-Noun parser logic while introducing dynamic visual synthesis and a retro-terminal aesthetic.

🎖️ Credit & Homage

Original Author: Scott Adams (Adventure International)
Release Year: 1978

This reconstruction is dedicated as an homage to the countless hours spent playing this game on the Texas Instruments 99/4A during the early 1980s. This project was born out of a desire to share the magic of early interactive fiction with a new generation—specifically my son—recreating the same sense of wonder we felt navigating from a London flat to a tropical island in search of treasure.

🛠️ How It Was Reconstructed

The game engine was "up-coded" from the original BASIC logic published in historical archives (such as BYTE Magazine, Dec 1980).

The Parser: Rebuilt in JavaScript to handle the classic two-word input system (Verb-Noun).

The Logic: Every room ID, item flag, and "magic word" (like YOHO) has been mapped to match the original game's difficulty and behavior.

Visuals: Integrated a modern generative image component that creates 8-bit, pixelated scene art based on the room descriptions to enhance immersion.

Interface: Styled with a "CRT Terminal" effect, complete with scanlines and glitch text to evoke the feeling of 1980s computing.
