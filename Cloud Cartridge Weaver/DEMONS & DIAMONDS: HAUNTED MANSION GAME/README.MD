🏚️ DEMONS & DIAMONDS: HAUNTED MANSION

Powered by the Cloud Cartridge System // Build 2026.2

🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

Method A: The Immersive Canvas (Collaborative)

The Setup: Open a new Gemini chat session on your PC or laptop.

The Upload: Drag and drop haunted_game.html directly into the chat.

The Command: Type "Open this in the immersive canvas" and hit enter.

The Process: Gemini renders the mansion. You can now survive levels, accumulate score multipliers, and generate bravery certificates in a high-performance environment.

Method B: The Portable App (Instant Browser Launch)

The Launch: Drag your HTML file from its folder and drop it directly onto your web browser's URL bar.

The Result: The browser initializes the "Cloud Cartridge" interface. The randomized demon logic and scoring engine work immediately.

Note: To enable full certificate saving features, ensure you have an active internet connection to load the html2canvas and Google Font libraries.

🎨 THE VIBE: RETRO-HORROR LOGIC

Note to the Survivor: This engine utilizes a "High-Stakes" probability loop. There are no safe paths—only calculated risks. It embraces a gothic, lo-fi aesthetic designed to provide a "Risk-First" gaming experience for the hacker and the digital explorer.

🧠 FUNCTIONALITY: WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES

Demons & Diamonds is a precision-engineered probability survival tool designed for the Architect to test nerve and luck within a structured 10-level hierarchy.

📝 Dynamic Scoring Engine: Implements a base 5/25 point system that DOUBLES every level ($2^x$ multiplier), rewarding those who push into deeper rounds.

🎼 Randomized Hazard Logic: A deterministic engine that anchors 3 Demons and 8 Diamonds across 11 openings every round.

📜 Certificate Generation: Captures your final achievement, player name, and grand score into a high-contrast "Certificate of Bravery" for digital export (.PNG).

🛠️ Responsive UI: Built with Tailwind CSS and "Special Elite" typography for a consistent, haunted atmosphere across all devices.

🛠 BASIC CONTROLS

📡 ENTER THE GROUNDS: Initiates the session and registers the survivor's name.

📽 SAVE CERT (.PNG): Exports a self-contained visual record of your final performance using html2canvas.

🛑 ADVENTURE TO NEXT ROUND: Triggers level progression once the "Safe Path" (Diamond) has been discovered.

🧹 PLAY AGAIN: Flushes the "Old Brain Disk" and resets the engine for fresh initialization.
