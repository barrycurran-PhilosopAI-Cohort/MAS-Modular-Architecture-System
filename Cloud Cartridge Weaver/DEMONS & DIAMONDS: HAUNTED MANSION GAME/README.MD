🏚️ DEMONS & DIAMONDS: HAUNTED MANSION

Powered by the Cloud Cartridge System // Build 2026.2

🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

Method A: The Immersive Canvas (Collaborative)

The Setup: Open a new Gemini chat session on your PC or laptop.

The Upload: Drag and drop haunted_game.html directly into the chat.

The Command: Type "Open this in the immersive canvas" and hit enter.

The Process: Gemini renders the mansion. You can now survive levels, accumulate score multipliers, and generate bravery certificates.

Method B: The Portable App (Instant Browser Launch)

The Launch: Drag your HTML file from its folder and drop it directly onto your web browser's URL bar.

The Result: The browser initializes the "Cloud Cartridge" interface. The randomized demon logic and scoring engine work immediately.

🎨 THE VIBE: RETRO-HORROR LOGIC

Note to the Survivor: This engine utilizes a "High-Stakes" probability loop. There are no safe paths—only calculated risks. It embraces a gothic, lo-fi aesthetic designed to provide a "Risk-First" gaming experience.

🧠 FUNCTIONALITY: WHAT THIS PROGRAM DOES

Demons & Diamonds is a precision-engineered probability survival tool designed for the Architect to test nerve and luck within a structured 10-level hierarchy.

📝 Dynamic Scoring Engine: Implements a base 5/25 point system that DOUBLES every level ($2^x$ multiplier).

🎼 Randomized Hazard Logic: A deterministic engine that anchors 3 Demons and 8 Diamonds across 11 openings every round.

📜 Certificate Generation: Captures your final achievement, player name, and grand score into a high-contrast "Certificate of Bravery" (.PNG).

📜 PHILOSOPHY & VISION: THE WEAVER'S LOGIC

This game is a functional manifestation of the Cloud Cartridge Weaver. It treats software as "Vapor Logic"—fluid, adaptable, and free from the constraints of traditional syntax fatigue. If the logic can be described, the Weaver can manifest it.
