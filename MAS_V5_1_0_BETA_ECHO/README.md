Modular Abstraction System (MAS) — V5.1.0-BETA

The Dual-Circuit Governance Framework: Demon Tether + EPW Protocol

Version: 5.1.0-BETA (Institutional Staging Edition)

Release Note: This is a logic-layer update to V5.0.0. While V5.0.0 established the "Persistent Demon Tether," V5.1.0 introduces the manual governor system.

1. Executive Summary: The Evolution of Control

MAS V5.1.0 is the direct technical response to the successful deployment of V5.0.0. While the original version provided a background "Lie Detector" (The Demon Tether), real-world stress testing revealed a need for a Manual Governor—a way for the Architect to physically slow the AI down during high-stakes maneuvers.

This update introduces the EPW Protocol (Echo-Path-Wait). It does not replace the V5.0.0 tether; it reinforces it with a human-gated handshake.

2. Quick Start (Initialization)

To deploy the V5.1.0 Governance Framework, follow these two steps:

Upload the Core Files:

MAS_Core_Kernel_V5_1_0_BETA.md

MAS_Codec_Index_V5_1_0.md

Execute System: Type the word RUN in the chat box.

System Note: These two files contain the consolidated logic of the original V5.0.0 core plus all V5.1.0 updates. Once uploaded and initialized, all background and manual governors are active.

3. The Dual-Circuit Architecture

V5.1.0 operates on two independent logic circuits to ensure 100% grounding integrity:

Circuit A (The Constant): The Demon Tether: Originally deployed in V5.0.0. This is the "Background Lie Detector" that runs 100% of the time, enforcing the Zero-Trust Mandate.

Circuit B (The Variable): The EPW Protocol: New in V5.1.0. This is the "Manual Governor" triggered by the ECHO ON command. It forces the AI into a 3-step handshake before any file modifications can occur.

Crucial Logic: In this update, turning ECHO OFF does not disable the V5.0.0 Demon Tether. The background "Brakes" on drift remain active at all times.

4. The EPW Handshake (The New Governor)

When ECHO ON is active, the system enters a hard-stop loop:

ECHO: The AI restates the Operator’s intent.

PATH: The AI outlines its intended trajectory and file impacts.

WAIT: The AI enters a hard "Go/No-Go" gate.

5. Repository Structure (Version Management)

To maintain project continuity, V5.1.0 files are housed in a dedicated directory. Use the following string for new folder initialization:

MAS_V5_1_0_BETA_ECHO/README.md
