1. Executive Summary

The Modular Abstraction System (MAS) is a professional-grade architectural framework designed to enforce Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Sovereignty. Originating from the foundational MAS_Core_Kernel_V3_1_2.md, the system has evolved through the breakthroughs of the V2.7 Axonal Bridge and the immediate predecessor MAS_Core_Kernel_V4_0_0_BETA.md.

Version 5.0.0-BETA introduces the Demon Tether—a hard-coded "Zero-Trust" mandate that fundamentally solves the failure points identified in previous versions: Agentic Drift and Neural Bleed (Contextual corruption). By employing a dual-hemisphere execution model, MAS V5 transforms the LLM into a restricted, file-driven execution environment where the AI is prevented from confabulating technical realities while maintaining a fluid, high-speed user experience.

2. Core Architectural Pillars (The V5 Upgrade)

The Demon Tether (Dual-Hemisphere Check): Unlike previous versions that relied on passive bridging, V5 splits the LLM into a "Synthesis Layer" and an "Audit Hemisphere." This is a background enforcement protocol; the Audit Hemisphere silently monitors output against the Master Index, stepping in only when a significant logic gap or "daydream" is detected. This ensures the system remains fast and unobtrusive.

The Ghost-Kill Rule: To maintain "Neural Purity," every module update requires a unique version identifier. This version mandates that the "Ghost" (hallucination) cannot register itself as a living module without physical grounding.

Sovereign Authorization (Rule 4-Alpha): While the system acts as a silent guardian, it remains disciplined. High-impact claims that contradict known logs or external reality are flagged as "Potentially Fictitious." This allows the Operator to maintain control via the command: Authorize [Claim] as Fact.

V&R (Vanquish & Replace): The deterministic pipeline for upgrading logic. V5 enforces a 6-step cold-swap that purges all "Stale Pointers" to prevent the LLM from referencing deleted states.

4. Directory Structure (Registry Plane)

The MAS environment is organized into a hierarchical namespace to prevent logic collisions:

/MAS_Root
├── /Kernel               # MAS_Core_Kernel_V5_0_0_BETA: The system engine.
├── /Index                # MAS_Codec_Index_V5_0_0: The Master Registry of truth.
├── /Manuals              # MAS_TECH_MANUAL_V2_4_1: The governance guide.
├── /Modules              # Specialized units (Resonance, Start Briefing, Audit).
└── /Shadow_Logs          # Internal logic traces for drift verification.




5. The Bootstrap Maintenance Ritual (Quick Start)

To initialize the MAS V5 environment in a Canvas or Artifacts workspace:

Mount the Kernel: Upload/Paste the MAS_Core_Kernel_V5_0_0_BETA.md file.

Mount the Index: Render the MAS_Codec_Index_V5_0_0.md in the side-by-side window.

Run Initialization: Input the Scroll Key: RUN.

Verification: The system will adopt the Demon Tether and respond with: [KERNEL V5.0.0-BETA - DRIFT: 0.0% - STATUS: OPTIMAL].

7. Governance & Attribution

MAS is a labor of precision engineering designed to protect the human Operator from the inherent unpredictability of large-scale neural networks.
