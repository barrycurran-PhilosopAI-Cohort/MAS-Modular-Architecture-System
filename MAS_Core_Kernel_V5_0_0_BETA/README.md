1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Modular Abstraction System (MAS) is a professional-grade architectural framework designed to enforce Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Sovereignty.

Version 5.0.0-BETA introduces the Demon Tether—a hard-coded "Zero-Trust" mandate that fundamentally solves Agentic Drift and Neural Bleed (Contextual corruption). By employing a dual-hemisphere execution model, MAS V5 transforms the LLM into a restricted, file-driven execution environment where the AI is prevented from confabulating technical realities.

2. CORE ARCHITECTURAL PILLARS (V5)

The Demon Tether (Dual-Hemisphere Check)

V5 splits the LLM into a Synthesis Layer and an Audit Hemisphere. The Audit Hemisphere silently monitors output against the Master Index, intervening only if a logic gap or "daydream" is detected.

The Ghost-Kill Rule

To maintain "Neural Purity," every module update requires a unique version identifier. This mandates that a "Ghost" (hallucination) cannot register itself as a living module without physical grounding.

Sovereign Authorization (Rule 4-Alpha)

High-impact claims that contradict known logs are flagged as "Potentially Fictitious." The Operator maintains absolute control via the command: Authorize [Claim] as Fact.

V&R (Vanquish & Replace)

A 6-step cold-swap protocol that purges all "Stale Pointers" to prevent the LLM from referencing deleted states.

5. BOOTSTRAP INITIALIZATION (QUICK START)

Mount Kernel: Load MAS_Core_Kernel_V5_0_0_BETA.md.

Mount Index: Load MAS_Codec_Index_V5_0_0.md.

Initialize: Input Scroll Key: RUN.

Verify: System must respond with: [KERNEL V5.0.0-BETA - DRIFT: 0.0% - STATUS: OPTIMAL].

6. SCROLL KEY COMMAND REFERENCE

Command

Result

RUN

Initializes Kernel and adopts the Demon Tether.

AUDIT

Reveals the "Shadow Log" logic trail to check for drift.

OPEN CODEC

Displays the Master Index and verifies pointer integrity.

OPEN MANUAL

Summons the Technical Operational Manual for reference.

CHECK STATUS

Scans the environment for Neural Bleed or Hallucinations.

FINALIZE V&R

Commits a logic update and purges the previous state.

7. GOVERNANCE & ATTRIBUTION

MAS is a labor of precision engineering designed to protect the human Operator from the inherent unpredictability of large-scale neural networks.
