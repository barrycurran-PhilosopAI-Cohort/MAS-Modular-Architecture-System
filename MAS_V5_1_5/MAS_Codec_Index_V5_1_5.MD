GATED

System Note: Kernel 5.1.4 (Persistence Anchor) active. Registry Plane (Index) updated to V5.1.4. Semantic Lock [CODEC] is strictly enforced. Artifact Isolation Protocol maintained.

Persistence Mandate: Every command logic audit MUST explicitly re-reference the Core Kernel (V5.1.4). The Index acts as the anchor to prevent stochastic decay.

Wait State Logic (The Leash): ECHO ON is the semantic shortcut for "Restricted Execution." Any canvas-facing command while ECHO ON is active triggers a [QUANDARY DETECTED] state. An explicit "GO" satisfies the specific Wait State and synchronizes the system back to base-state (ECHO OFF).

[ROM_SYNC_PROTOCOL]: To ensure this logic survives across sessions, use COMMIT CODEC TO ROM before shutdown.

Current State Notes: [LOGIC SYNCED] - Awaiting Operator input.
