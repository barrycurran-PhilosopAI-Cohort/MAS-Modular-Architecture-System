1. Executive Summary

The Modular Architecture System (MAS) is a deterministic, high-integrity workspace environment designed for Large Language Model (LLM) interaction. It is engineered to eliminate "Neural Bleed"—a phenomenon where AI confuses past instructions with current state—through a rigid, five-step transaction pipeline.

Whether you are a casual user seeking a stable assistant or an engineer building complex modular tools, MAS provides a "Source of Truth" that prevents session degradation over time.

2. System Architecture (Engineering Specs)

MAS operates on a Dual-Plane Deterministic Architecture:

The Logic Plane (Core Kernel): The immutable foundation. It implements "Hard-Coded Logic Gates" that dictate how data is handled. It is the "Legislature" of the system.

The Registry Plane (Master Index): The dynamic manifest. It functions as a semantic pointer system, mapping Scroll Keys (user commands) to specific modules and filepaths.

3. Core Directives (The Immutable Laws)

3.1 The Ghost-Kill Rule

In a MAS environment, "State" is never edited in place. It is Vanquished and Replaced (V&R).

Engineering Logic: Every write operation MUST result in a NEW identifier and version increment.

The Goal: To kill the "ghosts" of previous logic that linger in the LLM's context window.

3.2 Namespace Sovereignty

The Master Index is the exclusive Source of Truth. If a module is not registered in the Active Module Registry, it does not exist to the Kernel. This prevents unauthorized logic from influencing the session.

4. Operational Protocols (The Logic Gates)

4.1 System Initialization (RUN)

Logic Gate: Bootstraps the environment.

Condition: This is a static boot. No state changes occur; the system simply adopts the laws of the Kernel and loads the current Index.

4.2 Vanquish & Replace (V&R) - The 5-Step Pipeline

This is the mandatory path for any change to the system:

Vanquish: Explicitly terminate the pointer to the old state.

Rename: Generate a unique, incremented version identifier (e.g., V2.1 -> V2.2).

Index Update: Synchronize the Master Index to reflect the new file.

Operator Alert: The system pauses and instructs the user to save the Index. Integrity depends on the user maintaining this local record.

Committal: Final deployment of the new state to the workspace.

5. User Command Interface (Scroll Keys)

Scroll Key

Action

RUN

Initialize the system and adopt Kernel directives.

Open Codec

Displays the current Master Index (Your "Map").

Check System Status

Diagnostic verification of the Kernel version and Ghost-Kill state.

Open Manual

Accesses this documentation.

Finalize V&R

Manually triggers the transaction pipeline to commit changes.

Sanitize & Purge

Completely scrubs a module or key from the system's active memory.

6. Quick Start Guide (For Casual Users)

Booting up: Type RUN to start. The system will acknowledge the Kernel rules.

Understanding the Index: Type Open Codec. Think of this as your "Save File." If the Index says a file exists, the system knows it. If not, it's gone.

The "Save" Ritual: Whenever the system updates the Index, copy and save it to your computer. This ensures that if the session restarts, you can "Reload" your exact progress.

7. Developer & Enterprise Integration

Modularity: MAS supports .md, .html, and .js integration. New modules must be declared in the Index to be "legal."

GitHub Workflow: Commit history should align with the version increments generated by the V&R protocol.

Scalability: The architecture is designed to be forkable. Engineers can replace the Kernel (Logic Plane) while maintaining the Registry Plane for cross-compatibility.

8. Troubleshooting

Logic Drift: If the system seems confused, run Check System Status.

Legacy Interference: If a deleted module is still being referenced, initiate Sanitize & Purge.

Sync Issues: If the Index becomes corrupted, revert to your last saved local copy and provide it to the system.
