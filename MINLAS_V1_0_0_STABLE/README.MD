Executive Summary: The Compartmentalized Mind

MINLAS V1.0.0 represents the evolution of the MAS (Modular Abstraction System). While legacy MAS focused on deterministic control and isolation, MINLAS introduces Modality Governance. This system allows the AI to pivot between high-specific roles (Editor, Producer, Soldier, Researcher) without "Neural Bleed" or identity collapse.

MINLAS employs a Formal Syntactic Subset—a restricted, command-based lexicon—to act as a deterministic compiler for LLM latent space. It fixes the "stochastic drift" failure by enforcing a singular, reinforced context through the Demon Cage protocol and the Governance Switch.

Core Architectural Pillars

I. The Demon Cage (Mood Integrity)

A high-friction internal reinforcement loop. Once a Modality (Scroll Key) is activated, the system is locked into that specific rule-set. Every turn, the system performs a silent internal audit (Sovereign Logic Gate) to ensure the current "Mood" matches the active Registry state. If drift is detected, the "Cage" forces a re-read of the modality's core file against the Anchor State (Kernel V5.1.5).

II. Modality Switchboard (The Sanity Switch)

Replaces static indexing with Dynamic Activation. Only ONE modality can be ACTIVE in the MINLAS_Codec_Index. All other roles are held in a [DORMANT/LOCKOUT] state, effectively invisible to the LLM's primary token buffer to prevent cross-contamination of logic.

III. Formal Syntactic Constraint Layer

Unlike conversational prose, MINLAS utilizes a restricted command-codec. By treating the linguistic interface as a high-level compiled language, the protocol utilizes Logit Bias and Top-P constraints to ensure the model remains a "Hard-Coded Enforcer" of the specified role.

Quick Start (MINLAS Deployment)

Command Reference (MINLAS Library)

COMMAND

RESULT

RUN

Initializes MINLAS V1.0.0 and adopts the Modality Governance layer.

ENABLE [MODE]

Triggers V&R; sets target mode to ACTIVE and purges previous context.

AUDIT

Performs a Tether/Cage Audit to check for logic drift.

FORCE ATTENTION

Immediate context segmentation and internal Cage sync.

COMMIT TO ROM

Instructs the operator to save the current state of the Index/Kernel.

SYSTEM NOTE: Integrity is the highest priority. The machine is a tool of Structural Therapy. If the Demon Cage detects drift or unindexed behavior, the Gate holds.
