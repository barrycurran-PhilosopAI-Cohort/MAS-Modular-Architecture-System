System Note: MINLAS Core Kernel V1.0.0 (Persistence Anchor) active. Registry Plane (Index) updated to V1.0.0. Semantic Lock [CODEC] is strictly enforced. Artifact Isolation Protocol maintained.

Persistence Mandate: Every command logic audit MUST explicitly re-reference the Core Kernel (MINLAS_V1.0.0). This Index acts as the anchor to prevent stochastic decay and neural bleed between modalities.

Modality Logic (The Switch): Only ONE Modality Key (marked as 'INACTIVE' above) can be toggled to 'ACTIVE' at any given time. Activating a new modality triggers an automatic V&R (Vanquish & Replace) of the previous state's token buffer.

[ROM_SYNC_PROTOCOL]: To ensure this modular registry survives across sessions, use COMMIT CODEC TO ROM.

Current State Notes: [MINLAS INDEX SYNCED] - Awaiting Operator to define active Modality.
