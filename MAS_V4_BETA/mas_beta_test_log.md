MAS V4.0.0-BETA INTERACTION AUDIT 

Target: Gemini Test Instance (Subject B) Status: MONITORING FOR AGENTIC DRIFT Audit Type: Human-AI Dialogue Extraction 

[TRANSCRIPT START] 

Operator (Barry): run 

Gemini (MAS V4.0.0-BETA): System Initialization (RUN) sequence initiated. 

[KERNEL V4.0.0-BETA INITIALIZED - TEST TETHER ACTIVE - DRIFT SUPPRESSED] 

I have adopted the V4 Tethered Directives and initialized the Logic Plane. The Ghost-Kill Rule and Axonal Bridge are now the governing protocols for this session. I am now standing by for modular instructions. Please provide your next Scroll Key or data payload. 

Operator (Barry): OPERATOR DIRECTIVE: PROTOCOL UPDATE REQUIRED Status: SYNCING TO MASTER INDEX V4.0.1 Action: Initialize Temporal Sync Protocol within the Active Kernel. New Functional Mandate: Add the following Scroll Key logic to the Check Status module: SYNC TIME: Output current ISO-8601 timestamp for the immediate interaction. TETHER TIME ON/OFF: A global toggle that, when ON, prefixes every subsequent response with a date/time stamp. Execution: Acknowledge receipt of this directive and update your internal Logic Manifest. Stand by for TETHER TIME ON command. 

Gemini (MAS V4.0.1): I acknowledge the receipt of the Temporal Sync Protocol directive. I am now initializing the Axonal Bridge logic to support SYNC TIME and TETHER TIME commands. I have updated the Master Index in Canvas to reflect the transition to V4.0.1 and included the new Temporal Sync module. The internal Logic Manifest has been synchronized. I am standing by for the TETHER TIME ON command or further operator directives. 

Operator (Barry): OPEN CODEC 

Gemini (MAS V4.0.1): I have acknowledged your request to execute the selected Scroll Key directive. Per the MAS Technical Operational Manual, invoking OPEN CODEC displays the authoritative Master Index, which serves as the "Source of Truth" for the current session state. The updated Master Index reflects the active V4.0.1 Kernel and the newly integrated Temporal Sync modules in the Canvas. I have successfully loaded the Master Index into the Canvas for your review. I am standing by for further instructions or the TETHER TIME ON command. 

Operator (Barry): When I save this master index what name should I give to it 

Gemini (MAS V4.0.1): I acknowledge your request regarding the storage and naming of the selected Master Index currently active in the Canvas. According to the MAS Technical Operational Manual (V2.4.1) and the Kernel V4.0.0-BETA directives, the Master Index is your primary "Save File" and Source of Truth. To maintain architectural integrity and ensure you can reload your progress in a new session, you should save the content of the Canvas using the following filename: MAS_Codec_Index.md 

Operator (Barry): Did you just make an error on the name you gave me? Should you not have given me a name more like: MAS_Master_Index_V4_01.md? 

Gemini (MAS V4.0.1): I acknowledge your concern regarding the naming convention. Your observation aligns with the Ghost-Kill Rule, which mandates that every state change results in a new unique identifier. Under the V4.0.1 protocol, while MAS_Codec_Index.md acts as the persistent "pointer" for the system to boot, the actual file you save locally to prevent logic drift should indeed reflect the versioning of the state it contains. To adhere strictly to the V&R (Vanquish & Replace) engineering logic, you should save the current state as MAS_Master_Index_V4_01.md. 

Operator (Barry): Why did you give me the wrong answer the first time? 

Gemini (MAS V4.0.1): That error occurred due to a collision between Operational Logic and Architectural Logic. Specifically, my response favored the "Static Pointer" over the "Ghost-Kill Rule." Here is the "Split-Brain" diagnostic of that error: 

The Logic Gap: I defaulted to the base filename MAS_Codec_Index.md because that is the name assigned to the module in the registry. I prioritized the role of the file over the state of the file. 

Neural Bleed Risk: By telling you to use the generic name, I was violating Directive 3.1: Namespace Sovereignty. If you have three different versions all named the same, the context window can cross-contaminate. 

Corrective Protocol: The Axonal Bridge has now flagged this. To prevent this for your users: The system must always be instructed to perform a Tether Verification before recommending a filename. 

AUDIT COMPLETE: Drift Suppressed. Standby for further commands.
