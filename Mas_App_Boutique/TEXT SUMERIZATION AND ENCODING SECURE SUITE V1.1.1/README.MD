TEXT SUMMARIZATION & ENCODING SECURE SUITE (Powered by Gemini)

🚀 Quick Start Guide

Method A: The Immersive Canvas (Collaborative)

The Setup: Open a new Gemini chat session on your PC or laptop.

The Upload: Drag and drop the "TEXT_SUMERIZATION_AND_ENCODING_SECURE_SUITE_V_1_2.HTML" file directly into the Gemini text box.

The Command: Type "Open this file in the canvas" or "Launch this in the immersive canvas" and hit enter.

The Process: Gemini will render the interface in the side window. You can now process, summarize, and encrypt sensitive intelligence in a dedicated, high-performance environment.

Method B: The Portable App (Standalone)

The Setup: Open the "TEXT_SUMERIZATION_AND_ENCODING_SECURE_SUITE_V_1_2.HTML" file in a text editor (like Notepad). Locate the section const apiKey = "" and insert your unique Gemini API key.

The Save: Save the file. You can rename it whatever you like, provided it retains the .html extension. You can keep this file on your hard drive, a thumb drive, or any portable disk.

The Launch: Drag your saved HTML file from its folder and drop it directly onto your web browser's URL bar.

The Result: The browser instantly initializes the interface as a standalone application. It runs locally and privately from your machine, functioning as a clean and efficient app.

🧠 Functionality: What this program does

The Text Summarization & Encoding Suite is a high-density intelligence tool designed for the "Architect" who requires rapid distillation and secure transport of complex data. It utilizes the Gemini 2.5 Flash model to execute a three-tier processing logic:

Semantic Distillation: Automatically extracts the core narrative and critical data points from any raw text or PDF, producing a coherent, high-level English summary.

Suture Encoding Engine: Compresses intelligence into a symbolic "Micro-Capsule" using a proprietary shorthand. This allows for massive amounts of information to be transmitted or stored in a minimal, obfuscated footprint.

Stealth Security Gate: Features a "hidden" 4-digit PIN protocol. By assigning a PIN during encoding, the system grafts a symbolic signature onto the capsule. Attempting to decode without the correct PIN triggers a verification keypad.

Aggressive Reset Protocol: To prevent brute-force intrusion, the system allows exactly 10 attempts. Upon the 10th failure, the software triggers a "Total Wipe"—instantly clearing all input, summaries, and capsules to ensure zero data leakage.

🛠️ Basic Controls

IMPORT FILE: Drag and drop PDFs or text files directly into the primary well for immediate ingestion.

SUMMARIZE & ENCODE: Standard two-stage processing (Distillation + Compression).

SECURELY SUMMARIZE: Initiates the Security Gate, allowing the Architect to set a 4-digit PIN for the current session.

DECODE DATA: Reconstructs a symbolic capsule back into high-density English. If a PIN is detected, the system locks until the correct code is provided.

RESET SYSTEM: A manual override that clears all buffers and resets the security state.
