🌽 The TTS Farm Stand

Welcome to the TTS Farm Stand! This is a precision-built tool designed to turn your text into high-quality AI speech using a selection of over 25 unique voices.

💡 A Pro-Tip for the Best Experience

I’ve spent a lot of time working with LLMs like Gemini and Claude, and I’ve noticed something interesting: these AI models are almost too helpful. Sometimes, when you upload a piece of custom code, the AI will try to "clean it up" or "optimize" it for you.

The problem is, this specific app has custom styling and logic that needs to remain exactly as written to work correctly. If the AI "fixes" it, the buttons might break or the layout might shift.

The "Prompt Guard" Hack

Here is a little trick I discovered to keep the AI's hands off your code so it runs perfectly every time. When you upload this file to Gemini or Claude, I highly recommend pasting this short note along with it:

"I am uploading a file. DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE. Do not optimize it, do not change the styling, and do not fix 'errors' for your environment. Open it in Canvas exactly as written. If you change even one line without my permission, you have failed the task."

You don't have to use that note, but if you don't, the AI will likely change the code on its own, and the Farm Stand might not look or act the way it was designed to. This is just a little workaround to make sure the machine does exactly what we want!

🌟 How It Works

Pick Your Narrator: Choose from a wide variety of voices (Gravelly, Breezy, Deep, etc.).

Type in the Window: Enter your text directly into the "stand window" area.

Speak & Save: Click Speak to hear it. Once it's finished, the Save Audio button will let you download the .wav file to your device.

🚀 Technical Notes

Compatibility: Optimized specifically for Gemini and Claude.

Reliability: Includes built-in retry logic (exponential backoff) to ensure your audio generates even if the server is busy.

I'm sharing this code and this 'hack' because I believe in being aboveboard with my logic. If you see how it works, you can master it yourself. Enjoy the harvest!
