ON-DEMAND EVENTS BRIEFING (MAS Module v1.8.1)

🚀 Quick Start Guide

The Setup: Open a new Gemini chat session on your PC.

The Upload: Drag and drop the Current_Events_Breifing_1_0.HTML file directly into the Gemini text box.

The Command: Type "Open this file in the canvas" or "Launch this in the immersive canvas" and hit enter.

The Process: Wait for Gemini to process the code. Once it's ready, the program will open in the interactive window ready for use.

The Save: When you are done utilizing the program, tell Gemini to "Update my Codec Index." This ensures the system remembers the app and your active intelligence feeds.

The Move (Portability): To use this briefing engine on a different computer, tell Gemini "Open Codec." Copy that text string and save it. This string contains the app logic and your custom crawl parameters.

🧠 Functionality: What this program does

The On-Demand Events Briefing is a high-velocity intelligence platform designed to dismantle "information silos" and provide a unified, objective baseline of global events. It functions as a sophisticated news crawler and journalistic laboratory to move you from "reading the news" to "possessing intelligence." Key systems include:

Real-Time Intelligence Feed: A dynamic, multi-column dashboard that tracks live "crawls" across ten critical sectors (Politics, Tech, Science, etc.).

Strategic Synopsis: Generates a curated, high-level briefing of a story's core facts before deeper analysis begins.

Multi-Angle Framing: Automatically reconciles conflicting narratives to identify "Operational Truths" while outlining differing institutional perspectives.

Crawl Audit Transparency: Includes direct, verifiable links to primary sources for every briefing to eliminate hallucinations and ensure total transparency.

🛠️ Basic Controls

Initiate Global Crawl: Click to refresh the multi-angle feed and gather the latest headlines from across the ideological spectrum.

Deep Dive Research: Select any headline to move the story into the "Research Laboratory" for immediate synthesis.

Audit Trail: Toggle the Crawl Audit to verify the primary sources used for the current intelligence brief.
