# Growth Manifesto: Loose Leaf Lettuce
*Scientific Name: Lactuca sativa (Acephala Group)*

## Timeline
- **Germination:** 7-14 days. Requires consistent moisture and cool temperatures (55-65°F optimal). High temperatures (above 80°F) can prevent germination (thermo-inhibition).
- **Maturity:** 30-60 days, depending on variety and whether harvesting baby leaves (3-4 weeks) or full size.

## Consumption & Edibility
Highly edible. Leaves are consumed raw in salads, sandwiches, and wraps. High water content and good source of vitamins A and K.

## Sowing Instructions
Direct sow 1/4 inch deep in early spring or late summer/fall. Optimal soil temperature is 40-75°F (4-24°C). Plant every 2-3 weeks for continuous harvest.

## Propagation
Primarily by seed. Can be temporarily propagated by regrowing the trimmed root base in water or soil to produce a small secondary harvest of new leaves.

## Preservation
Best eaten fresh. Store short-term (up to 10 days) by wrapping loosely in damp paper towels and placing in the refrigerator crisper drawer. Not suitable for freezing or canning due to high water content.
