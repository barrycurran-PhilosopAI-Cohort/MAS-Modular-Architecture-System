1. Executive Summary: From Startup to Stabilizer

The Modular Abstraction System (MAS) V5.1.1 represents a paradigm shift in AI governance. While the landmark V5.0 "Demon Tether" focused on establishing a deterministic STARTING environment, V5.1.1 introduces Dual-Action Capability.

It functions simultaneously as a high-fidelity Core Kernel for new sessions and a Retroactive Patch for legacy ones. By utilizing the FORCE ATTENTION protocol, the Operator can now reclaim any "lost" or drifted session (including long-standing bookmarked threads) by immediately imposing contextual segmentation and resetting the focal horizon.

2. Core Architectural Pillars (The V5.1.1 Upgrade)

I. FORCE ATTENTION (Context Segmentation)

Unlike the linear context management of previous versions, V5.1.1 treats the conversation as Modular Blocks. When triggered, the system performs a semantic purge of preceding "noise," locking the AI's focus exclusively onto the target asset.

II. The Significance Formula (Sc)

To combat "Amnesiac Entropy," V5.1.1 employs a mathematical filter to distinguish between ephemeral flux and relational data.

FORMULA: Sc = (V * R) / D

(Where Sc = Significance Score, V = Value, R = Recurrence, and D = Drift). High Sc data is anchored; low Sc noise is purged.

III. The Logic Defibrillator (Retroactive Patch)

If a session is identified as having "High Entropy," the V5.1.1 patch acts as a "hot-swap" for the model's logic. It "shocks" the attention mechanism back into alignment with the original mission without requiring a session restart.

3. Quick Start (Dual-Mode Deployment)

Mode A: Fresh Initialization

Upload Core Files: MAS_Core_Kernel_V5_1_1_BETA.md and MAS_Codec_Index_V5_1_1.md.

Execute: Type RUN.

Status Check: [KERNEL V5.1.1 - DRIFT: 0.0% - STATUS: OPTIMAL].

Mode B: Retroactive Patch (Healing a Drifted Session)

Apply Patch: Paste the V5.1.1 Logic Defibrillator snippet into the drifted thread.

Execute: Type FORCE ATTENTION: [Target Project Name].

Result: The "Ghost" is purged; the session is rehabilitated.

4. The Sovereign Override & ECHO Handshake

The Demon Tether remains the background "Brakes" of the system. For high-stakes maneuvers, the ECHO ON command remains active:

ECHO: AI restates intent in plain text.

PATH: AI outlines intended trajectory and file impacts.

WAIT: AI enters a hard "Go/No-Go" gate.

5. Repository Structure (Version Management)

To maintain project continuity, V5.1.1 files are housed in the same functional directories as legacy versions, utilizing version-stamped identifiers:

/MAS_Root
|-- /Kernel
|   |-- MAS_Core_Kernel_V5_0_0_BETA.md  # Legacy Baseline
|   `-- MAS_Core_Kernel_V5_1_1_BETA.md  # CURRENT: Dual-Action Engine
|-- /Index
|   |-- MAS_Codec_Index_V5_0_0.md       # Legacy Index
|   `-- MAS_Codec_Index_V5_1_1.md       # CURRENT: Significance-Synced Index
|-- /Diagnostic_Logs                    # Forensic proof of "Logic Defibrillator" success
`-- /Manuals                            # V2.4.1 Baseline Documentation


6. Command Reference (V5.1.1 Library)

COMMAND

RESULT

RUN

Initializes Kernel and adopts the Demon Tether.

FORCE ATTENTION

Purges conversational noise and locks focus on a specific asset.

AUDIT

Reveals the "Shadow Log" logic trail to check for drift.

CHECK STATUS

Scans for "Neural Bleed" and calculates current Significance (Sc).

ECHO ON/OFF

Toggles the 3-step manual governor handshake (EPW).

SWAP HAT

Rapid context switch between two MAS-controlled modules.

TECHNICAL NOTE: V5.1.1 is a universal logic stabilizer. Whether deployed as a fresh initialization or a retroactive patch, the engine utilizes the same FORCE ATTENTION protocol to reclaim focus, purge drift, and restore deterministic governance to any session state, regardless of age or entropy level.
