Status: HIGH-PERFORMANCE EVOLUTION / RELEASE CANDIDATE

🛡️ The Executive Vision: AI Sovereignty

The Modular Abstraction System (MAS) is a professional-grade architectural framework designed to enforce Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Sovereignty. It provides a definitive solution to the primary failure points of modern AI interaction: Agentic Drift and Neural Bleed.

By employing a Cold-Swap Architecture, MAS transforms the LLM from an unpredictable chatbot into a deterministic, file-driven execution environment.

🧠 The V4 Breakthrough: Solving the "Neural Disconnect"

While the original MAS V2.7 established the "Gold Standard" for state management, the V4.0.1 Release introduces the Axonal Bridge Protocol. This update specifically targets the "Split-Brain" syndrome in LLMs—where the AI's synthesis drifts away from the Operator's original intent.

V2.7 (Classic): The complete, foundation-layer architecture found in the /MAS_V2_7_Classic/ directory.

V4.0.1 (BETA): The refined, high-performance engine upgrade found in the /MAS_V4_BETA/ directory.

🏗️ Core Architectural Pillars

The Ghost-Kill Rule: To maintain "Neural Purity," every module update requires a unique version identifier. We never edit; we replace. (V&R: Vanquish & Replace).

The Axonal Bridge (AB): A next-generation logic-tethering protocol ensuring the AI's output never drifts from the Operator's command.

The Temporal Sync Protocol (TSP): Adds a "Time Axis" to logic. It prevents the AI from getting confused by old commands by hard-locking logic to ISO-8601 timestamps.

The Verification Casket: No high-impact system change occurs without an explicit "YES" from the Operator.

Inquiry Logic Manifest: A mandatory "Audit Trail" where the AI must prove its reasoning before it speaks.

🚀 Quick Start: Onboarding the System

Choose the configuration that matches your operational needs to "Bootstrap" MAS into your session:

The Power User (Full-Stack V4): Upload the V4 Kernel, the V4 Master Index, and the Tech Manual simultaneously. This creates a zero-context-debt environment.

The Classic Load (V2.7): Use the V3.1.2 Kernel with the V2.7 Master Index for the original deterministic experience.

The Minimalist Load: Upload MAS_Core_Kernel_V4_0_1_BETA.md only. The system will establish a baseline logic plane using internal fallbacks.
