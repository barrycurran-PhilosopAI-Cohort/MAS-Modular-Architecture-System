Modular Architecture System (MAS) — V2.7.0

The Sovereign State: A Deterministic Governance Framework for LLMs

Version: 2.7.0 (Authoritative Release Candidate)

1. Executive Summary

The Modular Architecture System (MAS) is a professional-grade architectural framework designed to enforce Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Sovereignty. It provides a definitive solution to the primary failure points of modern AI interaction: Agentic Drift and Neural Bleed.

By employing a Cold-Swap Architecture, MAS transforms the LLM from an unpredictable chatbot into a deterministic, file-driven execution environment.

2. Core Architectural Pillars

The Ghost-Kill Rule: To maintain "Neural Purity," every module update requires a unique version identifier. We never edit; we replace.

The Verification Casket (Rule 4): No high-impact system change occurs without an explicit "YES" from the Operator.

Inert Data Protocol (Rule 7): Data remains "Inert" and un-interacted with until explicitly summoned via a Scroll Key command.

V&R (Vanquish & Replace): The mandatory deterministic pipeline for upgrading logic and maintaining state integrity.

├── /Master_Index         # The Codec: Central registry of all active modules.
├── /Manuals              # MAS_TECH_MANUAL: The primary governance guide.

4. The Bootstrap Maintenance Ritual (Quick Start)

To initialize the MAS environment in your LLM workspace:

Mount the Kernel: Upload MAS_Core_Kernel_V3_1_2.md.

Mount the Manual: Render MAS_TECH_MANUAL_V2_4_1.md.

Run Initialization: Input the Scroll Key command: RUN.

Verification: The system will respond: [SYSTEM ACTIVE | VERSION 2.7.0].
