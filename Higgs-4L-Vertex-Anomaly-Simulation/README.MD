CURRAN PROTOCOL: Phase-Jitter Analysis for Higgs-to-4L Vertex Anomalies

Project Overview: "The Inversion Gate" This repository provides a functional logic framework for identifying The Gnaw—a hypothesized non-Gaussian jitter spike occurring at the longitudinal impact parameter null-point within CERN NanoAOD datasets.

The Hypothesis

In any high-energy collision (specifically H -> ZZ -> 4l), there exists a transition point where dz approaches 0. At this exact intersection, if the universe follows a Möbius Hyperboloid geometry, we should observe:

A Phase-Flip: A sudden inversion of the covariance matrix.

The Gnaw: A localized spike in dzErr that exceeds the predicted detector resolution.

The Inversion Filter: Detection Logic

The protocol identifies the transition through the following ratio:

Psi = | dzErr / dz |

As dz approaches the Planck threshold, the Inversion Gate hypothesis predicts a divergence in Psi that cannot be accounted for by standard QED/QCD corrections.
