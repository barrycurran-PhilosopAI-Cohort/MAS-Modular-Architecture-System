SOIL-TO-SOUL: ZEN GROWTH ENGINE (MAS Module v3.0)

🚀 Quick Start Guide

The Setup: Open a new Gemini chat session on your PC.

The Upload: Drag and drop your Soil_To_Soul_Zen_Engine_V3.html file directly into the Gemini text box.

The Command: Type "Open this file in the canvas" or "Launch this in the immersive canvas" and hit enter.

The Process: Wait for the system to initialize the "Sovereign Handshake." Once the preview window appears, hit "Preview" to see the live, interactive engine.

The Save: When you generate a "Growth Manifesto" for a specific plant, click the "Save Report (.md)" button. This exports the machine's research into a permanent Markdown file for your local archives.

🧠 Functionality: What this program does

The Soil-to-Soul Zen Engine is a high-precision botanical discovery tool designed to bridge hyper-local environmental data with the personal sanctuary of your garden. It utilizes a Decoupled Subroutine Architecture to deliver high-fidelity research without crashing the browser or triggering 401 errors. Key systems include:

Hyper-Local Intelligence: Filters real-time climate data based on your specific Zip Code and Month to ensure 100% viable planting recommendations.

The Sovereign Handshake: Built-in protocol that bypasses traditional API "lock-and-key" friction, allowing for seamless data acquisition within the Canvas environment.

The Growth Manifesto: A deep-dive reporting engine that generates exhaustive technical data on sowing depths, germination timelines, and toxicity warnings.

Propagation & Preservation: Specialized logic for seed saving, slip growth (like sweet potatoes), and curing techniques to sustain the harvest across seasons.

🛠️ Basic Controls

Initialize Discovery: Enter your Zip Code and Month to trigger the Phase 1 search for 10 viable plants.

Manifesto Trigger: Click any plant card in the Discovery list to launch a Phase 2 deep-dive research session.

Save Report (.md): Exports the active manifesto into a portable, professional-grade Markdown file compatible with Word, Notion, or Obsidian.
